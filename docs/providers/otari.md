# Using Otari

[Otari](https://otari.ai) is an open-source LLM gateway with an OpenAI-compatible API.
An open agentic website can use it as its LLM router. Mozilla runs a hosted Otari, and
you can also run one yourself. For other providers, see [LLM providers](providers.md).

Both work from a static bundle:

| Router | Static bundle (`--static-bundle`) |
|---|---|
| Hosted Otari (`otari.ai`) | Works, but some models fail on every request. See [Hosted Otari](#hosted-otari-otariai). |
| Self-hosted Otari | Works, if Otari allows the site's origin |

## How the page reaches the LLM

In the `⚙ BYOK / router settings` panel, the `API key`, `Model` and `Router base URL`
fields decide where LLM requests go. The browser sends each request to the Router base URL.

**Static bundle.** `nsdeploy`'s `--static-bundle` builds plain files with no server and no relay.
The browser calls the router itself, so the router must allow browser calls (CORS).
An empty Router base URL means the `--upstream` URL given at build time.

OpenAI allows browser calls, which is why the static bundle in the
[Quickstart](../quickstart.md#manually-generate-a-website-bundle) works with it. Hosted Otari
allows them too.

## Hosted Otari (otari.ai)

Hosted Otari allows browser calls from any site, so a static site can call it directly.
In the `⚙ BYOK / router settings` panel, set:

- API key: an API key from your [otari.ai](https://otari.ai) account.
- Model: `alibaba/qwen-3.5-35b-a3b`
- Router base URL: `https://api.otari.ai/api/v1`

Click `Apply, save & reload`, then chat.

Things to know:

- **Base URL.** It must end in `/api/v1`. Plain `/v1` returns 404, and the browser
  reports that as a CORS error.
- **Pick a chat model that makes tool calls.** `GET /api/v1/models` lists every model.
  Look for `"type": "chat"` and `tools` in `supported_parameters`.
- **Some models fail on every request.** With `alibaba/qwen3-14b` and
  `alibaba/qwen3-30b-a3b`, every chat fails with
  `LLM HTTP 400: This model's maximum context length is 40960 tokens. However, you requested 40960 output tokens ...`.
  The site doesn't set an output limit, and for these models the request then asks for
  the model's whole context window as output. That leaves no room for the prompt. Other
  models with the same window, such as `alibaba/qwen3-32b`, don't have this problem. If
  you see this error, pick another model, such as `alibaba/qwen-3.5-35b-a3b`.

## Self-hosted Otari with local models

This runs Otari in Docker in front of [Ollama](https://ollama.com) on your machine, so
no LLM provider key is needed.

### 1. Pull a model

```shell
ollama pull gemma4:e4b
```

### 2. Make a key

Make a folder for the Otari config and key:

```shell
mkdir otari
cd otari
```

You make up the Otari key yourself. Otari creates every key listed in its config when
it starts. This command writes a random key to `key.env` without printing it:

```shell
(umask 077; python3 -c "import secrets; print('OTARI_LOCAL_API_KEY=tk-' + secrets.token_urlsafe(48))" > key.env)
set -a; . ./key.env; set +a
```

The key only works on your local Otari. Keep `key.env` out of git.

### 3. Write `config.yml`

```yaml
database_url: "sqlite+aiosqlite:///./otari.db"
default_pricing: true
providers:
  ollama:
    api_base: "http://host.docker.internal:11434"
    models: [gemma4:e4b]
pricing:
  "ollama:gemma4:e4b":
    input_price_per_million: 0
    output_price_per_million: 0
cors_allow_origins:
  # "*" lets any website call Otari from the browser. Each call still needs a valid key.
  # To allow only your own sites, list their exact origins (scheme, host and port) instead.
  - "*"
api_keys:
  local-test:
    secret: ${OTARI_LOCAL_API_KEY}
    user_id: local-test
```

- **`pricing`:** Otari refuses a model with no price (402). Give each local model you
  want to use a zero-price entry like the one above.
- **`cors_allow_origins`:** the origins of pages allowed to call Otari from the browser.
  - `"*"` allows pages on any website. Otari still refuses a call without a valid key.
  - To allow only specific sites, list their exact origins instead: scheme, host and
    port, with no path. `http://localhost:8080` and `http://127.0.0.1:8080` are
    different origins.
  - The [Quickstart](../quickstart.md#manually-generate-a-website-bundle) serves its
    bundle at `http://127.0.0.1:8080`.

### 4. Start Otari

From the folder with `config.yml`, in the shell where you loaded `key.env`:

```shell
export OTARI_CONFIG_YAML="$(cat config.yml)"
docker run --rm --name otari-local --publish 127.0.0.1:8042:8000 \
  --env OTARI_LOCAL_API_KEY --env OTARI_CONFIG_YAML \
  mzdotai/otari:0.36.0 otari serve
```

Otari's base URL is now `http://127.0.0.1:8042/api/v1`. On Linux, `host.docker.internal`
may need `--add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway` on `docker run`.

Otari keeps its database inside the container, so it starts empty each time. That's
fine here, because it creates the key from `config.yml` when it starts.

### 5. Point the site at it

Open an agentic website in a browser,
and expand `⚙ BYOK / router settings`:

- API key: the value after `OTARI_LOCAL_API_KEY=` in `key.env`.
- Model: `google/gemma4-e4b` (or `ollama:gemma4:e4b`; both work).
- Router base URL: `http://127.0.0.1:8042/api/v1`

Click `Apply, save & reload`, then chat.

Things to know:

- **Model IDs.** `GET /api/v1/models` lists local models under catalog-style IDs such as
  `google/gemma4-e4b`. It also lists other Ollama models found on the host. Those return
  402 until you add a pricing entry for them.
- **Local models are slow.** A multi-agent turn can take a minute or more.
- **For a public site,** run Otari on a server behind HTTPS, and set Router base URL to
  its address, such as `https://otari.example.com/api/v1`. If `cors_allow_origins` lists
  exact origins, add your site's origin, such as `https://example.com`. Browsers block an
  `https` page from calling a plain `http` address other than `localhost`.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause and fix |
|---|---|
| Chat shows `⚠️ Failed to fetch`, console shows "blocked by CORS policy" | The browser is calling a router that doesn't allow this page. Hosted Otari: check that Router base URL ends in `/api/v1`. Self-hosted Otari: add the page's exact origin to `cors_allow_origins`, or use `"*"`, and restart Otari. |
| 400 "This model's maximum context length is ... However, you requested ... output tokens" | Hosted Otari: this model fails when the request sets no output limit, and the site doesn't set one. Pick another model, such as `alibaba/qwen-3.5-35b-a3b`. |
| The site keeps using an old router | The panel saves your setup in the browser. On `localhost` and `127.0.0.1` it is also kept in a cookie shared by every local port for 180 days, so a router saved for another site follows you. Set Router base URL to the router you want, or clear it to use the site's default, then `Apply, save & reload`. |
| 400 `invalid_model` | Use an exact model ID from `GET /api/v1/models`. |
| 402 "No pricing is configured" | Self-hosted: add a `pricing` entry for that model. |
| 404 "Otari serves its API under /api/v1" | The base URL must end in `/api/v1`, not `/v1`. |
| 401 "Invalid API key" | The key is wrong. Self-hosted: check that `OTARI_LOCAL_API_KEY` was set in the shell that ran `docker run`. |
